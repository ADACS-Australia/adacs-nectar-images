# Instructions
The script `launch_instance.sh` will spin up an instance of the image which you can then connect to via ssh to perform manual tests. It requires $IMG to be set for the particular image you want to test. e.g. `IMG=../image_vars/image_basic.sh ./launch_instance.sh`.

To tear down the resources, run the script `destroy_instance.sh`
